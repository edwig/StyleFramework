StyleFramework
==============

Framework to add a modern 'material design' look to standard MFC programs.
Adding themed colors, flat scrollbars, flat buttons and style typed controls
for about every part of your program.
For examples of programs see the three accompanying test projects

- TestDialogs: Various dialogs and user controls
- TestFrame: MainFrame windows for MDI and SDI interface applications
- TestProperties: Property page dialogs

Although the documentation in the 'Documentation' directory is still somewhat skeleton,
the conversion from standard MFC to StyleFramework programs is quite straightforeward.

Please read: Documentation\Documentation.docx
and please see: StyleLibrary\StyleFramework.h
