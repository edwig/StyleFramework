VERSION 1.2.1 of xx-xx-2025
---------------------------
1)  Ported to Visual Studio 20206
2)  - Added scrollbar bitmaps for high DPI settings (125%, 150% and 200%)
    - Fix for StyleScrollBar to properly display the new bitmaps
    - Fix for several classes to properly use the DPI changes per monitor
    - Changed the use of GetSystemMetrics to GetSystemMetricsForDpi where needed
3)  TAKE ACTION:
    - Re-implement your resource file numbers between 135 and 200 for the new scrollbar bitmaps
      So review your resource.h file for this number range

VERSION 1.2.0 of 07-11-2025
---------------------------
1)  This version supports High DPI and multiple monitors with different DPI settings
    To convert a program, add the "Manifest.xml" file to your project in the project settings
    in the "Manifest Tool" section. This sets the DPI-awareness to "Per Monitor v2".
    Turn off all other DPI settings in the project settings.
2)  The Multi-monitor capabilites are implemented in the StyleDialog and StyleFrameWnd(Ex) classes.
    They will automatically adjust their scaling when moved to another monitor with a different DPI.
3)  The following Multi-monitor messages are handled automatically:
    WM_GETDPISCALEDSIZE         -> Get the scaled size of the window for the current DPI (Sent first)
    WM_DPICHANGED_BEFOREPARENT  -> Sent to all the controls before the parent is resized
    WM_DPICHANGED               -> Sent to parent, resizing takes place here
    WM_DPICHANGED_AFTERPARENT   -> Sent to all the controls after the parent is resized
    WM_DISPLAYCHANGE            -> Sent when a monitor is added/removed or resolution changed

    BEWARE: It may be needed to override and handle some of these messages in your own code

4)  The source directory (StyleFramework) contains a file "Manifest.xml" that you can include in 
    your application project directory in order to set the "MonitorV2" manifest. Also see under 1)
    In addition you can remove the standard linker comment section in your "stdafx.h" file to
    add the comctrl version 6.0 manifestdependency. It is already included in the manifest.xml file.

VERSION 1.1.0 OF 24-12-2023
---------------------------
1) Small fix for the StyleComboBox OnSetFocus function while destructing the object.
2) Added tooltips to individual cells of the grid. This is a work instruction
   1) Add to be used tooltips to the grid as a whole under a reference number with
      grid.SetTitleTip(n,"This is a titletip text");
   2) Give each cell a title tip number referencing the grid mapping as in
      CGridCellBase* cell = grid.GetCell(row,col);
      cell->SetTipNumber(n)
   This keeps the number of tips down to a global level in the grid and there will be no need
   to allocate a string for each cell.
   If a cell has a tip-number: that will take precedence over the displaying of over long 
   contents of the current cell.
   If a cell has no tip-number (GetTipNumber() returns -1) than the titletip is used for
   contents that cannot be displayed as a whole, like it used to be.

VERSION OF 30-11-2023
---------------------
1) Fix for the GridCellNumeric to test for a digit in the InPlaceEdit to prevent strange
   error messages and gray pieces of background in the grid
2) ReWrite of the GridCellCombo. It's now implemented on the basis of a StyleComboBox
   This makes for a better handling of the keyboard in the combobox list of the grid
   See the grid example in TestDialogs for a column of CBS_DROPDOWN and CBS_DROPDOWNLIST
3) It's now possible to call "DragAcceptFiles(TRUE)" for a StyleEdit control in either
   a StyleDialog or a StyleTab. Just implement your own override of the method
   StyleDialog::OnDroppedFile(UINT p_id,UINT p_index,LPCTSTR p_fileName)
   For an example look up the first text field of the TestDialogs example where you can
   drag a file from the Windows Explorer to this box.

VERSION OF 27-07-2023
---------------------
1) Fix for navigating StyleComboBox lists with the keyboard cursur keys

VERSION OF 05-06-2023
---------------------
1) It is now possible to create StyleComboBox'es that can have a non-standard height.
   In stead of a CComboBox on the resources, you can use a dynamic resource with a Rect size
   of your own liking.
   Take the following steps after declaring your StyleComboBox

   m_myCombo.Create(WS_CHILD|WS_VISIBLE|WS_TABSTOP|CBS_DROPDOWNLIST,rect,this,IDC_MYCONTROL);
   m_myCombo.InitSkin();
   m_myCombo.ReadjustDynamic();

VERSION OF 02-02-2023
---------------------
1) StyleListBox now knows how to sort it's items
2) Header control of StyleListBox fixed. Also works in the 'Dark Theme'
3) ListBoxes need no longer to be OWNERDRAWFIXED. Regular listboxes from the 
   standard resources will now work exactly the same

VERSION OF 21-01-2023
---------------------
1) Added the StyleTab for replacament of StyleDialog in a Tab-control
2) Added the setting of an environment variable in RegistryManager
3) Re-work on the WinToast to be able to supply standard MBCS strings
4) Expansion of the StyleDialog to provide standard methods for things normally
   generated in the MFC wizards
   - SetAboutBoxAndIcon
   - OnQueryDragIcon
   - IsIconic painting in the OnPaint

VERSION OF 11-09-2022
---------------------
1) Added percentage to the StyleProgressCtrl
2) Added a StyleStatic for the CStatic (Old StyleStatic is renamed to StyleStaticToast)

VERSION OF 05-03-2022
---------------------
1) The 'base version' of the new 'Dark mode'
   Work needs still to be done on various controls (StyleListCtrl & StyleTabCtrl)
   This is a very good example of what dark-mode will look like

VERSION OF 04-12-2021
---------------------
1) Updated to VS2022
2) Better handling of the default button in a StyleMessageBox

VERSION OF 10-08-2021
---------------------
1) Library is updated to MS-Windows SDK 10 (latest) and C++ ISO 2020 (latest)

VERSION OF 11-07-2021
---------------------
1) You can only drag the edges of dialogs and FrameWnd's if they are not in the WS_MAXIMIZE 
   state. This was done to avoid horrible drawing bugs. And it's the normal MS-Windows behaviour
2) Dialogs can now resize to a LARGER size, but never to a SMALLER size as defined in the *.rc file
   This is done, so that controls do not obscure each other on the screen.
3) After resizing, the combobox edit boxes again paint correctly and not with a double border.

Version of 24-06-2021
---------------------
1) StyleEdit boxes that are **NOT** multiline are now created without a style frame
   to greatly reduce the number of GDI objects in an application
   Only multiline StyleEdit objects still have a styling framework

Version of 02-05-2021
---------------------
1) Release version 1.0.1
2) StyleLibrary renamed to StyleFramework (libraries and directories)

Version of 02-04-2021

Version of 28 march 2021

   - Enable/disabled window state and still show the list
   - Can scroll outside of the application window (!)
4) Added the "StyleToast" class
5) Added the "StyleSpinButtonCtrl" class
6) Removed all "Init()" functions. The initialisation is done in PreSubClassWindow
   or in the InitSkin() function inside the DDX_Control function
7) Removed the IMGButton class. All buttons are now "StyleButton"s
8) Re-wrote the grid, so that grid comboboxes and checkboxes are themed
9) Fixed a bug in StyleTreeCtrl. Must have a border to cleanly resize and still be styled

Version of 21 march 2020

2) LinePrinter is now default in English. 
   Use methods to set the text of the header/footer

   or revert to "CTabCtrl::InsertItem()"
   
Version of 25 march 2020
------------------------

5) AutoGrayScreen works in all three main window forms when using
   StyleMessageBox instead of ::MessageBox

Version of 27 march 2020
------------------------
6) New function SetRegistryProfile(CString p_key,CString p_program,CString p_version)
   So the main program can set a version of the workspace profile.
   If not the correct version: the profile WILL be deleted from the registry
   and thus protecting the program from crashing while loading the old profile.
   
Version of 18 april 2020
