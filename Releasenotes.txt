---------------------
1) The 'base version' of the new 'Dark mode'

VERSION OF 11-07-2021
---------------------
1) You can only drag the edges of dialogs and FrameWnd's if they are not in the WS_MAXIMIZE 
   state. This was done to avoid horrible drawing bugs. And it's the normal MS-Windows behaviour
2) Dialogs can now resize to a LARGER size, but never to a SMALLER size as defined in the *.rc file
   This is done, so that controls do not obscure each other on the screen.
3) After resizing, the combobox edit boxes again paint correctly and not with a double border.

Version of 24-06-2021
---------------------
1) StyleEdit boxes that are **NOT** multiline are now created without a style frame
   to greatly reduce the number of GDI objects in an application
   Only multiline StyleEdit objects still have a styling framework

   or in the InitSkin() function inside the DDX_Control function
7) Removed the IMGButton class. All buttons are now "StyleButton"s
8) Re-wrote the grid, so that grid comboboxes and checkboxes are themed

   StyleMessageBox instead of ::MessageBox

Version of 27 march 2020
------------------------
6) New function SetRegistryProfile(CString p_key,CString p_program,CString p_version)
   So the main program can set a version of the workspace profile.
   If not the correct version: the profile WILL be deleted from the registry
   and thus protecting the program from crashing while loading the old profile.
   
Version of 18 april 2020
